# ESPbreakout
## Overview
ESPbreakout is a breakout board for the popular ESP32-s3  chip that includes many breakout pins, compatible with any other ESP32 setup (for the most part), and has programming via USB 2.0.
This board uses the ESP32-S3 SOC, which means that it does not use any of the modules that espressif has already made, and just the bare ESP32-S3 chip.
This board includes pins for progamming, a USB-C port (for programming & power), a screw terminal to convenient wire up a Lithium battery to (3.7v). And you can also utilize the PSRAM that I added externally onto the board. The board includes comprehensive labels for buttons and pins, for ease of use. The cost and materials used to manafacture/make this board are in the BOM.csv file.

## Intent behind making this board:
I made this board to showcase what I already know, and to learn a lot of new things (I can say that this one was accomplished). I also made this board to act as a substitute for the ESP32-S3 devboard that exists, and of course it wont be better than the board made by the actual company, Espressif, but it will be pretty decent and working!

(Pictures of the built version will be added once I get all the components and solder what needs to be soldered, for the most part this is PCBA though.)
