## 10/16/2025 - Wired some basic connections + did the USB-C wiring

I added the main chip, wired some basic connections on the main chip itself, but I also added some stuff related to USB-C, infact that is what I spent most of this time on. I also wired up some basic pin headers, might need to change that in the future, but that is some progress. I also took some more time to make sure all of my connections were good; that is important for a devboard.  

## 10/20/2025 - Added some more gpios, added some basic wiring for the power

I wired up more GPIO pins, I cant figure out how to do the power pins so in the meanwhile I asked some people on the slack and while they were responding I added a screw terminal and added some capacitors. I also refurbished the schematic section for the other crystal.  

## 10/21/2025 - Wired important pins on main chip, USB-UART and GPIO's

I spent a good chunk of my time today just looking through docs to wire some important pins on the main chip right, because if I dont I could have issues with booting it up. I also added some more GPIO's to the headers and ill do power pins tommorow. I added USB-UART and added a stepdown for my battery input from 3.7v to 3.3v, with capacitors ofc to smoothen out the signal.  

## 10/24/2025 - Cleaned up schematic, wired PSRAM, wired power pins.

Today I spent a LONG while figuring out how to do the power pins after scraping the internet and my friends for a while. I also took a good chunk of time to wire the PSRAM which is the external RAM that im adding that can be accessed at any time. I also took a lot of time to clean up the schematic formatting AND I did a lot of minor changes like adding some more resistors, inductors capacitors and fixing some wiring where it was needed.

Tommorow the schematic should be done!  

## 10/25/2025 - Finalizing schematic, assigning footprints and designing.

Today, I took a while to finalize my schematic and send it to some more knowledgable people, and the KiCad discord. Then I spent a long time getting the correct footprints for each parts. And then the main chunk of this time was spend starting with the routing, I got pretty far but I have to figure out something better for the capacitors, as space is limited, I think that wont be too much of a problem however. (note to self: find a better footprint for the usb-c)  

## 10/26/2025 - Rerouted pcb, chose configuration  

Today was entirely a PCB design day, I had to redo the design twice and mess with a bunch of traces for hours on end to get this to fit and work nicely, but now I have a issue with vias that I dont feel like fixing now, that can wait for tommorow as I still need to figure out the proper fix for it. I also spend a substantial amount of time figuring out the best way to put all the components.
