I added the main chip, wired some basic connections on the main chip itself, but I also added some stuff related to USB-C, infact that is what I spent most of this time on. I also wired up some basic pin headers, might need to change that in the future, but that is some progress. I also took some more time to make sure all of my connections were good; that is important for a devboard.
